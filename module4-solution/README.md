# Module 4 Coding Assignment
### Coursera course: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers

Let's write a little bit of Javascript programming code to practice what we've learned! Woohoo! :-)

#### Time to complete: About 30 minutes.

Ask questions in Discussions if you get stuck! We are all learning, and going through getting stuck and then unstuck (even with someone's help) can be a very valuable learning experience!

Summary: In this assignment, you are going to loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.
